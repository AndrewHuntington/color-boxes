# Color Boxes

A matrix of randomly colored boxes that change when you click them. Boxes will always change to a different color when clicked.

## Purpose

To practice working with props, defaultProps, states, and simple click events in React.

Project idea originally from The Modern React Bootcamp. All code written by me. Copyright 2021.
